Project Title: Web Application Deployment Using AWS ECS and ECR

Project Description: This project involved the development of a streamlined application, packaging it to form a Docker image, solving the image to undergo Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and carrying out the deployment with the utilization of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

The crucial steps can be summarized as follows:

Application Development:Created a basic application to serve as the deployment target

Dockerization:Prepared a Dockerfile that describes the containerized application and ensures it runs reliably. One way of creating a Docker image is to carry out a local build and test it to confirm the application functions as expected.

Pushing to Amazon ECR: I made a repository in Amazon ECR to store and manage the Docker image in ECR repository securely.

Deployment with Amazon ECS:I set up an ECS cluster and defined task definitions for the application. Created a service to manage the application instances and ensure high availability. Deployed the application, leveraging ECSâ€™s orchestration capabilities for scaling and management.

Technologies Used:

Docker: For containerizing the application.

Amazon ECR: For storing and managing Docker images.

Amazon ECS: For deploying and managing the application.

Outcome:

The project successfully demonstrated the end-to-end deployment of a Dockerized application on AWS, utilizing ECS for scalability and ECR for efficient image management. This setup ensured a reliable and scalable environment for running the application, highlighting the strengths of using containerization and cloud services in modern application development and deployment
